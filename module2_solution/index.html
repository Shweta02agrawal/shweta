      <h2>Pani puri</h2>
      <p>pani puris are known as "golgappas" in Northern India and as "poochkas" in West Bengal. pani puri is crisp semolina puris filled with sprouts and chilled mint flavoured water make a great snack for a hot summer afternoon. When my favourite â€œ pani puri wallah" is serving me these delightful little puris one after the other, I just go on eating till I can eat no more! Sprouts can be replaced by hot ragda to complement the chilled mint water.</p>
